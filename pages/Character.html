              The Chosen Ones. He is kind and strong but struggles with
              arrogance. Seeking redemption for his past immaturity, Kenny

              different abilities based on his surroundings. Despite his
              involvement with a gang of street thugs, a situation forced upon

              escape the gang and turn his life around if he genuinely desires
